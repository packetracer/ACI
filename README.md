# Python ACI Scripts
This is my python script repo for Cisco ACI.

There are many like it, but this one is mine. 

My github repo is my best friend. It is my life. 

I must master it as I must master my life. 

My github repo, without me, is useless. 

Without my github repo, I am useless.

Notes from author:
I'm not responsible if you mess up your environment.  
You probably already messed it up by buying ACI in the first place.

Safety not guaranteed.

These scripts are tuned for my naming conventions.  It should be mostly trivial to adjust templates to meet your naming needs.
These scripts are written in and meant for python 2.7

Don't like it any of the scripts in this repo or think they are trash?
